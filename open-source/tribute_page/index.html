        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">His hit song</a> 
        <p>1966: Born on February 6 in Newton-le-Willows, England.</p>
        <p>1985: Rick Astley’s music career began when he joined a band called FBI (not to be confused with the U.S. government agency). He later signed with Stock Aitken Waterman, the famous British production trio.</p>
        <p>1987: Released his debut single, "Never Gonna Give You Up" in July, which became an international hit. The song topped the charts in 25 countries and became his signature track. It was followed by his debut album, Whenever You Need Somebody, which also included hits like "Together Forever" and "Whenever You Need Somebody."</p>
        <p>1988-1991: Astley enjoyed continued success with several chart-topping singles, including "Together Forever" and "She Wants to Dance with Me." His debut album went multi-platinum, and he won several music awards, solidifying his place in the pop music scene.</p>
        <p>1993: Astley decided to step back from the music industry. He took a break to focus on his personal life, including marriage and raising a family. He also distanced himself from the high-pressure world of pop fame.</p>
        <p>2000s: In the early 2000s, Astley largely stayed out of the public eye, though he did make occasional appearances. His music career was revitalized when the "Rickrolling" meme went viral in 2007. The meme involved redirecting users to the "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video as part of an internet prank. This brought Astley’s music to a new generation of fans.</p>
        <p>2007-2010: Astley returned to the spotlight with new music, including the album Portrait (2005) and the compilation album The Best of Rick Astley (2009). He also began touring again.</p>
        <p>2016: Released his album 50, which marked a major return to form, blending classic pop with a more mature sound. The album was well-received by both fans and critics.</p>
        <p>2020s: Continues to tour and release music, including the album Beautiful Life (2018). He remains a beloved figure in pop culture, with a strong fan base and a continued presence in the music industry.</p></p>
